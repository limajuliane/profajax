                Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?<br>
                I won't have to hold my breath 'til you get down on one knee<br>
                Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough<br>
                Did you ever feel me?, Would you ever picture us?<br>
                Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear<br>
                That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because<br>
                What's the point of crying? It was never even love<br>
                Did you ever want me?, Was I ever good enough?<br>
                Thе-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar<br>

                Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough<br>
                Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough<br>
                Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough<br>
                He say that I'm good enough, grabbin' my duh-duh-duh<br>
                Thinkin' 'bout shit that I shouldn't have (huh)<br>
                So I tell him there's one of me, he makin' fun of me (ha-ha)<br>
                His girl is a bum to me (grrah)<br>
                Like that boy is a cap, sayin' he home but I know where he at, like<br>
                Bet he blowin' her back<br>
                Thinkin' 'bout me 'cause he know that ass fat (damn)<br>
                And it been what it been (uh, huh)<br>
                Callin' his phone like, "Yo, send me your PIN"<br>
                Duckin' my shit, 'cause he know what I'm on (grrah)<br>
                But when he hit me I'm not gon' respond (grrah)<br>
                But I don't sleep enough without you<br>
                And I can't eat enough without you (huh)<br>
                If you don't speak, does that mean we're through? (Huh)<br>
                Don't like sneaky shit that you do (grrah)<br>
                The-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar<br>
                He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy<br>
                The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar<br>
